#The Data

We will be looking at data of over **7,000 foods**.
All recorded by the United States of America
Deparment of Agricultural.

 
Nutrition is the key to living longer.
Obesity in America has been a reoccuring problem.


In 2008, the **obesity** rate among Adult Americans
was esitmated for men (32.5%)
and for women (35.5%).


![Fat Americans in 2008](C:/Users/Mar/Desktop/3710/food_project_share/obesity.jpg)


------

We will be reading in the data from the **U.S.D.A**
in order to point out healthier foods.


This exact data will be read in below as USDA
and food.

USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference

  https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/  

 https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-human-nutrition-resear  ch-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/sr28-download-files/ 
 
 "food <- read.csv("ABBREV.csv")" 
 
 Reading in the data and saving it as the data frame "USDA".

```{r}
# Read the csv file
  library(dplyr)

  USDA = read.csv("USDA.csv")
```


We are also reading in the ABBREV.csv and saving it as "food".

```{r}
food <- read.csv("ABBREV.csv")
```


This will give us the structure of the dataset food.

```{r}
# Structure of the dataset
 str(food)
```
There are 8,790 observations of 53 variables.


The first is an inter code number of the specific food.

The second is a Factor with the name and/or description of the
food/s.

The remaining variables consist of a combination of
numbers and intergers.  They are specific measuremnts
of certain chemicals found in food e.g. water, iron, 
protein, calcium, thiamine, etc.

We Will be taking a much closer look at Thiamine.

------


##Thiamine

Also known as Vitamin B1.

Thiamine or vitamin B1 is a healthy additive found in some common foods.  

If a person does not intake the proper amount of Thiamine alot of problems
can occur.  A thiamin deficiency can result in Beriberi or Wermicke Encephalopathy.   
These disesases effect the cardiovascular or nervous system.  

Lack of thiamine can be extremely dangerous.   

The function of Thiamine is a coenzyme that is used by the body
to metabolize food for energy.  Thiamine also maintains proper
cardiovascular and nervous system functions.

Alot of thiamine molecules are found in proteins
and carbohydrates.

Some countries have written laws to require the 
addition of thiamine to certain foods(grains).  

In the United States you can get a month supply of vitamin B1 for under $25.  

This report will focus on *Thiamine*, a chemical compound, but
a significant varible in the USDA dataset.


![Thaimine Foods](C:/Users/Mar/Desktop/3710/food_project_share/b1.jpg)

------

We are going to take a closer look at Thiamine to see if it has any
relation to other food characters e.g. Protein or Fat.

```{r}
# Statistical summary
  summary(food)
```

A summary of the food data tells us that 
the average amount of Thiamine .2231mg.

There is only one extreme Thiamine 
concentration at 23.3750mg.

-----

Let's find out which food that is.
We will use which.max to find the 
row.

```{r}
# Finding the index of the food with highest sodium levels
  which.max(food$Thiamin_.mg.)
```

If we use the name function we can
see all the variable names.

Shrt_Desc is the food description 
variable.

We want to find the food name of
the 8735 row.

```{r}
# Get names of variables in the dataset
  names(food)
# Get the name of the food with highest sodium levels
  #USDA$Description[265]
  food$Shrt_Desc[8735]
```

Interesting the food is "YEAST EXTRACT SPREAD".
Nobody would ever eat this.

![Yeast Extract Spread](C:/Users/Mar/Desktop/3710/food_project_share/yeast.jpg)

This makes sense beacuse Thiamine is normally
found in grains or used as a healthy additive.

There must be alot of Thiamine in Yeast.

------

Let's take a look at other foods with alot
of Thiamine.

```{r}
# Create a subset of the foods with Thiamine content above 2.5mg
 HighThaimin = subset(food, Thiamin_.mg.>2.5)

# Count the number of rows, or observations
  nrow(HighThaimin)
```
There are 42 foods with more than 2.5mg of Thiamine.

```{r}
# Output names of the foods with high Thiamine content

  HighThaimin$Shrt_Desc
```
**Interesting, very interesting.**  

Who doesn't love a box of Raisin Bran Crunch?
Thiamine rich people sure do not.


It seems that alot of Thiamine 
rich foods are Cereals, Baby-Food,
Soup, Sesame Flour, Power Bars,
Formula Bars, some Beef, and a few
others.



We would not really want to eat 
Baby-Food or Seasame Flour but
the others are very interesting.

------

This makes sense because Thiamine
is found in whole grains and some meats
but is also used as a healthy dietary
additive.

```{r}
# Summary function over Thiamine vector
  summary(food$Thiamin_.mg.)

# Standard deviation
  sd(food$Thiamin_.mg., na.rm = TRUE)
```

The **mean** Thiamine is **.2231mg** with a
**standard deviation** of **.5238mg.**


### Plots

Let's plot Thiamin vs Saturated Fat from the food data frame.
```{r}
# Add xlabel, ylabel and title
  plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$FA_Sat_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Saturated Fat", main = "Thiamin vs Saturated Fat", col = "blue")

```


This did not give us much.
There is the one "Yease Extract Spread"
outlier around 24mg. Everthing else is mostly bunched up.

It seems that saturated fat however
has a reverse relationship with Thiamine.
When there is more saturated fat there
is less Thiamin and vice versa.

```{r}
  plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$FA_Sat_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Saturated Fat", xlim = c(0,1), main = "Thiamin vs Saturated Fat", col = "blue") 
```
A closer look at Thiamine vs Saturated Fat.  The more Thiamine the less
saturated fat it seems.

------

```{r}
plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$Carbohydrt_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Carbs", xlim = c(0,1), main = "Thiamin vs Carbs", col = "green")

plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$Carbohydrt_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Carbs", xlim = c(0,5), main = "Thiamin vs Carbs", col = "orange")
```
Without the 0 values Thiamin and Carbs have a somewhat
linear relationship.  If a food has alot of Thiamine
it usually has alot of carbs.

-----

```{r}
plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$Protein_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Protein", xlim = c(0,1), main = "Thiamin vs Protein", col = "purple")

plot(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$Protein_.g., xlab="Thiamin", ylab = "Protein", xlim = c(0,5), main = "Thiamin vs Protein", col = "red")
```
It seemes alot of foods with Thiamine
have around 20mg of protein.

------

### Histogram of Thiamine
```{r}
# Breaking of Thiamine histogram
  hist(food$Thiamin_.mg., xlab = "Thiamine (mg)", main = "Histogram of Thiamine", xlim = c(0,1), breaks=1500)
  hist(food$Thiamin_.mg., xlab = "Thiamine (mg)", main = "Histogram of Thiamine", xlim = c(0,1), breaks=2000)
```
Alot of foods have very little Thiamine.  There
are a couple foods that have a ton of Thiamine like
Yeast.

------

### Boxplot
```{r}
# Boxplots
  boxplot(food$Thiamin_.mg., ylab = "Thiamine (mg)", main = "Boxplot of Thiamine")

  boxplot(food$Thiamin_.mg., ylab = "Thiamine (mg)", ylim = c(0,5), main = "Boxplot of Thiamine")
  
  boxplot(food$Thiamin_.mg., ylab = "Thiamine (mg)", ylim = c(0,1), main = "Boxplot of Thiamine")
  
  
```

------

### Comparing High Values with Thiamine

We want to add a variable to our USDA data
frame that takes a value 1 if the food has higher
Thiamine than average, and 0 if the food has
lower Thiamine than average.
```{r}
# Creating a variable that takes value 1 if the food has higher Thiamine than average, 0 if else.
  HighThiamine = as.numeric(food$Thiamin_.mg. > mean(food$Thiamin_.mg., na.rm=TRUE))
  str(HighThiamine)
```

------

Let's add some more of these varibles for Carbs,
Protein, and Fat.
```{r}
# Adding the High Thiamine variable to the dataset
  food$HighThiamine = as.numeric(food$Thiamin_.mg. > mean(food$Thiamin_.mg., na.rm=TRUE))
```

```{r}
# Let's do the same for HighProtein, HigCarbs, HighFat
# I think all will be interesting varibles to consider against
# High Thiamine.
  food$HighCarbs = as.numeric(food$Carbohydrt_.g. > mean(food$Carbohydrt_.g., na.rm=TRUE))
  food$HighProtein = as.numeric(food$Protein_.g. > mean(food$Protein_.g., na.rm=TRUE))
  food$HighFat = as.numeric(food$FA_Sat_.g. > mean(food$FA_Sat_.g., na.rm=TRUE))
```

------

```{r}
# How many foods have higher Thiamine level than average?
  table(food$HighThiamine)
```
2212 foods have higher than average Thiamine content.

------

```{r}
# How many foods have both high Thiamine and high carbs?
  table(food$HighThiamine, food$HighCarbs)
```

It seems most of the foods are not high in carbs or thiamine.
There are 763 foods listed as high in carbs and high
in thiamine.

It seems you can get a high dosage of Thiamine in foods
with high amounts of carbs.

Which makes sense because Thaimin is normally found in grains.

------

```{r}
# Average amount of Thiamine sorted by high and low protein?
  tapply(food$HighThiamine, food$HighProtein, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

It seems on average there is more thiamine concentration (.28mg)
when a food has high amounts of protein than low (.26mg).

------

```{r}
# Maximum level of Thiamine in foods with high and low carbs?
  tapply(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$HighFat, max, na.rm=TRUE)

# Using summary function with tapply
  tapply(food$Thiamin_.mg., food$HighFat, summary, na.rm=TRUE)
```
There is a higher concentraion of Thiamine .23mg when fat is low
then when there is high fat .21mg.

------

#Conclusion

**Thiamine** is also known as **Vitamin B1**.

Thiamine is a very healthy **dietary addtive**.
It is found in **grains**, **protein bars**, and **some meats e.g. bacon**.

There is **more Thiamine** in foods that are **low in fat**, **high in protein**, and **high in carbs**.

I would suggest eating **protein bars** or whole wheat grains like **cereal** for your necessary
Thiamine intake.

In order to prevent Thiamine related severe diseases.

**Eat This**
